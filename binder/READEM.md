# Binder directory

This directory contains a ```requirements.txt``` file with the added requirement of **matplotlib** and **antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11**, thus enabling jupyter notebooks hosted by mybinder.org to display graphics and convert LaTeX to SymPy understandable format. 

Use the binder badge below to start an interactive jupyterhub server.
